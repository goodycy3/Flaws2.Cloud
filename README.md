# Flaws2.cloud 
<p>The <b> &quot;flaws 2 challenge&quot;<b> is a game designed by Summit Route that teaches Amazon Web Services (AWS) security concepts. It's similar to the original &quot;flAWS.cloud&quot; and focuses on AWS-specific issues rather than general security concerns like buffer overflows or XSS. There are two paths available: <a href="http://level1.flaws2.cloud/">Attacker</a> and <a href="http://flaws2.cloud/defender.htm">Defender</a>. <br> 🚩 In the Attacker path, players exploit misconfigurations in serverless and container services. <br> 🚩 In the Defender path, players act as incident responders, analyzing logs and learning how to set up Athena for log analysis.</p>
